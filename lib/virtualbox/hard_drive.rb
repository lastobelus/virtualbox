module VirtualBox
  # Represents a hard disk which is registered with VirtualBox.
  #
  # # Finding a Hard Drive
  #
  # Hard drives can be found use {HardDrive.all} and {HardDrive.find}, which
  # find all or a specific hard drive, respectively. Example below:
  #
  #     VirtualBox::HardDrive.all
  #
  # Or:
  #
  #     VirtualBox::HardDrive.find("Foo.vdi")
  #
  # # Creating a Hard Drive
  #
  # The hard drive is one of the few data items at the moment which supports
  # new creation. Below is a simple example of how this works:
  #
  #     hd = VirtualBox::HardDrive.new
  #     hd.location = "foo.vdi"
  #     hd.size = 2400 # in megabytes
  #     hd.save
  #
  #     # You can now access other attributes, since its saved:
  #     hd.uuid
  #     hd.location # will return a full path now
  #
  # Although `VDI` is the default format for newly created hard drives, other
  # formats are supported:
  #
  #     hd = VirtualBox::HardDrive.new
  #     hd.format = "VMDK"
  #     hd.location = "bar.vmdk"
  #     hd.size = 9001 # Its over 9000! (If you don't understand the reference, just ignore this comment)
  #     hd.save
  #
  # Any formats listed by your VirtualBox installation's `VBoxManage list hddbackends` command
  # can be used with the virtualbox gem.
  #
  # # Destroying Hard Drives
  #
  # Hard drives can also be deleted, which will completely remove them from
  # disk. **This operation is not reversable**.
  #
  #     hd = VirtualBox::HardDrive.find("foo")
  #     hd.destroy
  #
  # # Cloning Hard Drives
  #
  # Hard drives can just as easily be cloned as they can be created or destroyed.
  #
  #     hd = VirtualBox::HardDrive.find("foo")
  #     cloned_hd = hd.clone("bar")
  #
  # In addition to simply cloning hard drives, this command can be used to
  # clone to a different format:
  #
  #     hd = VirtualBox::HardDrive.find("foo")
  #     hd.clone("bar", "VMDK") # Will clone and convert to VMDK format
  #
  # # Attributes
  #
  # Properties of the model are exposed using standard ruby instance
  # methods which are generated on the fly. Because of this, they are not listed
  # below as available instance methods.
  #
  # These attributes can be accessed and modified via standard ruby-style
  # `instance.attribute` and `instance.attribute=` methods. The attributes are
  # listed below. If you aren't sure what this means or you can't understand
  # why the below is listed, please read {Attributable}.
  #
  #     attribute :format, :default => "VDI", :property => :format
  #     attribute :logical_size, :property => :logical_size
  #     attribute :physical_size, :readonly => true, :property => :size
  #
  # There are more attributes on the {Medium} model, which {HardDrive} inherits
  # from.
