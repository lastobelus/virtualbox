module VirtualBox
  # When a VM uses NAT as its NIC type, VirtualBox acts like its
  # own private router for all virtual machines. Because of this,
  # the host machine can't access services within the guest machine.
  # To get around this, NAT supports port forwarding, which allows the
  # guest machine services to be forwarded to some port on the host
  # machine. Port forwarding is done completely through {ExtraData}, but
  # is a complicated enough procedure that this class was made to
  # faciliate it.
  #
  # **Note:** After changing any forwarded ports, the entire VirtualBox
  # process must be restarted completely for them to take effect. When
  # working with the ruby library, this isn't so much of an issue, but
  # if you have any VMs running, they must all be shut down and restarted.
  #
  # # Adding a new Forwarded Port
  #
  # Since forwarded ports rely on being part of a {VM}, we're going to
  # assume that `vm` points to a {VM} which has already been found.
  #
  #     port = VirtualBox::ForwardedPort.new
  #     port.name = "apache" # This can be anything
  #     port.guestport = 80
  #     port.hostport = 8080
  #     vm.forwarded_ports << port
  #     port.save # Or vm.save
  #
  # # Modifying an Existing Forwarded Port
  #
  # This is assuming that `vm` is a local variable storing a {VM} object
  # which has already been found.
  #
  #     vm.forwarded_ports.first.hostport = 1919
  #     vm.save
  #
  # # Deleting a Forwarded Port
  #
  # To delete a forwarded port, you simply destroy it like any other model:
  #
  #     vm.forwarded_ports.first.destroy
  #
  # # Attributes and Relationships
  #
  # Properties of the model are exposed using standard ruby instance
  # methods which are generated on the fly. Because of this, they are not listed
  # below as available instance methods.
  #
  # These attributes can be accessed and modified via standard ruby-style
  # `instance.attribute` and `instance.attribute=` methods. The attributes are
  # listed below.
  #
  # Relationships are also accessed like attributes but can't be set. Instead,
  # they are typically references to other objects such as an {AttachedDevice} which
  # in turn have their own attributes which can be modified.
  #
  # ## Attributes
  #
  # This is copied directly from the class header, but lists all available
  # attributes. If you don't understand what this means, read {Attributable}.
  #
  #     attribute :parent, :readonly => true
  #     attribute :name

  #     attribute :protocol, :default => "TCP"
