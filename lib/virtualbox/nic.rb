module VirtualBox
  # Represents a single NIC (Network Interface Card) of a virtual machine.
  #
  # **Currently, new NICs can't be created, so the only way to get this
  # object is through a {VM}'s `nics` relationship.**
  #
  # # Editing a NIC
  #
  # Nics can be modified directly in their relationship to other
  # virtual machines. When {VM#save} is called, it will also save any
  # changes to its relationships.
  #
  #     vm = VirtualBox::VM.find("foo")
  #     vm.nics[0].macaddress = @new_mac_address
  #     vm.save
  #
  # # Attributes
  #
  # Properties of the model are exposed using standard ruby instance
  # methods which are generated on the fly. Because of this, they are not listed
  # below as available instance methods.
  #
  # These attributes can be accessed and modified via standard ruby-style
  # `instance.attribute` and `instance.attribute=` methods. The attributes are
  # listed below. If you aren't sure what this means or you can't understand
  # why the below is listed, please read {Attributable}.
